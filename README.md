# Escape Buttons

Buttons that are hard to click.  Perfect for making that "no thanks" option on your newsletter signup modal impossible to click.  Desktop only - as all buttons use mouse events.

## Usage

[Download the library](https://www.thecssking.com/EscapeButtons) and include it on your page.  Add class `btn-escape` and the class of the specific button you want (ie `btn-push` or `btn-jump`) directly to the button (or link) you want to move around.

### Secret Button

There is a sixth button hidden somewhere on the page - see if you can find it.
